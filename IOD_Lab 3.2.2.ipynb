Depending on thier beliefs, they may range from wanting it by coexsting with non jews or eradicating everyone else.\n","\n","Some secular jews believe that israel is needed due to worldwide historical persecution of jews, and that they arent safe anywhere where they are not the majority. They believe that only with a jewish state, no one can persecute them, and what better place to set it up, they claim is to be at the holy place. Do note that secular and religious jews can share each others beliefs, as religious jews also claim that there is persecution against them worldwide.\n","\n","Some non jews also support israel, in terms of world governments and other organizations. For instance, world governments may want israel to exist because its one area where they can have a friendly base at for personal interest in the middle east.\n","\n","Funny enough some christians (especially the US) believe an israel should exist because of religion. They believe that when the jews return to the holy land and make a nation, and builds the 3rd temple, the rapture will begin. The rapture is the christian equivalent of \"kiamat\" the end of the world. Basically on this day, jesus would return again, but this time to bring all those who are \"good enough\" to heaven, leaving the rest and the world to be destroyed (or sent to hell, you pick). Personally i find it odd that they would depict jesus as a vengeful being on the second coming (some literally believe he will come riding a horse or a pegasus with a spear red with the blood of sinners). After which they dont care about the jews, they see them as a key to go to heaven and throwing them under the bus because \"they arent christians\"\n","\n","The last group im aware of are the islamophobes or racist against arabs.

The majority of the population are the Malays (all of whom are Muslims), followed by Chinese, Indians & other smaller ethic groups. We have been trained to learn, understand & respect people of different races & cultures in family & at school. But some politicians still like to play the racial cards to try to disharmonize & disintegrate us, but it all depends on the people whether to trust these politicians or do the right thing.

You'll see a lot of foreigners around: tourists, digital nomads, working expatriates & immigrants. It's a modern, well developed city. We don't live in tree houses as some Americans believe.

It's convenient. \n","\n","Another option is to find a condominium  within the vicinity of Bukit Bintang or KL Sentral where the metro stations are nearby.\n","\n","If staying near KLCC or Bukit Bintang or KL Sentral is beyond your budget, then opt to stay at a condominium that is close to another metro station. There are many advertised on AirBnB, so do extensive research about it.\n","\n","As for food, don't worry!

And since the Sarawak government recently made plans to acquire airports in the state, Kuching, Sibu, Miri, Bintulu and the smaller Sarawakian airports can be sold to the Sarawak government. All the other airports can either  e sold to private investors, state governments or revert control to the CAAM. \n","\n","This way, MAHB can be reorganized as a smaller and more nimble company which can focus on its own assest such as KLIA, Subang, Penang and KK and spare enough cash to further CAPEX & OPEX to improve its remaining airports.\n","Score: 3\n","--------------------\n","Comment ID: l9so5nh\n","Author: sirloindenial\n","Body: Caused me an accident from microsleep, bump and push a car in front of me which hit another in front of it.

But if you want to know what's Pinjaman Boleh Ubah, I believe it's a form of loan payment reduction. This is a rather unique form of loan repayment whereby the amount of loan that you have to repay depends on your CGPA (or academic performance). The better your academic performance, the smaller the amount you have to pay back. The reason why it's not a scholarship is because, well, you still have to pay back some amount of money that you have loaned. Excerpt:\n","\n","**Apakah yang dimaksudkan dengan Pinjaman Boleh Ubah?**\n","\n","Pinjaman Boleh Ubah (PBU) bermaksud keseluruhan pinjaman pelajaran yang diterima boleh dipertimbangkan pengurangan bayaran balik berdasarkan prestasi akademik pelajar setelah tamat pengajian, tertakluk kepada dasar yang ditetapkan.\n","\n","Kadar Pengurangan Pinjaman MARA berdasarkan CGPA\\*\n","\n","◾3.5 - 4.0   - Bayaran balik 15% dari jumlah pinjaman\n","\n","◾3.0 - 3.49 - Bayaran balik 20% dari jumlah pinjaman\n","\n","◾2.5 - 2.99 - Bayaran balik 25% dari jumlah pinjaman\n","\n","◾2.0 - 2.49 - Bayaran balik 30% dari jumlah pinjaman\n","\n","\\*Tertakluk kepada perubahan\n","\n","  \n","See: [https://www.uniassist.my/post/biasiswa2024#viewer-dt3gw62](https://www.uniassist.my/post/biasiswa2024#viewer-dt3gw62)\n","\n","You can outright ask the officer from MARA what the latest rates are, and how the scheme works. Just email them or call them.\n","--------------------\n","Comment by UngkuAmer: Yup it's a pinjaman boleh ubah but the repayment is in installment and there is no interest on the principal amount so I believe that it is worth it on itself and I'm sure the repayment could be negotiated for it to be manageable for you.\n","\n","As for the experience overseas, it is also worth it. It may changed your perspective towards different parts of life and you can experience things you may not be able to in Malaysia. Down the line when you felt like living overseas is not for you, you can always come back home.\n","--------------------\n","Comment by a_HerculePoirot_fan: Thanks! Any specific branch?\n","--------------------\n","Comment by stuffsurgeon: Remember that there're only 10% of the matrikulasi seats made available to non-bumis. I hope you have a backup plan, and start thinking of alternatives if you didn't manage to get in the first time. It's rather unlikely that your rayuan will succeed, because you're banking on any of the 10% of non-bumis who got in dropping out to give you a \"seat\" (knowing how difficult it is to get into the program for non-bumis, and how easy it is to secure a seat in local university in your program of choice after finishing the course, it is highly unlikely for anyone to drop out).\n","\n","I don't think there's any reason why you should feel discouraged. Academic achievement is only one of the criteria that matrikulasi looks at for admission, but they also place more emphasis for folks who come from the suburban rural areas, families with poorer background etc. The system is rigged against you, and there's nothing you should feel ashamed or discouraged about.\n","--------------------\n","Comment by snel_: Am happy to help share some information on studying psychology, feel free to ask if you're having any questions on this.\n","\n","I do however wish to ask, are you familiar with all the different post-SPM options i.e. STPM, A level, foundation etc.?\n","--------------------\n","Comment by stuffsurgeon: There are only 4 paths to get into local public universities if you insist on getting into one. I'm going to call a spade a spade and list the 4 of them from the easiest (in terms of course material) to the hardest. Options:\n","\n","1. Asasi (foundation), but this route admits almost 100% bumi only. Almost guaranteed to get a spot in public universities (unless you majorly screwed up). \n","\n","2. Matrikulasi (matriculation), but this route admits almost 90% bumi only. If you're non-bumi and you manage to secure a spot within the 10% of seats in matrikulasi, please take it. You're almost guaranteed a spot to get into local university. Course material is also relatively easy. \n","\n","3. Politeknik (polytechnique), if you're non-bumi, this is honestly your most realistic shot to get into local university. Course material is also relatively easy. However the odds of you getting into local university is not as high as Matrikulasi or Asasi.\n","\n","4. STPM (formerly known as HSC), if you're non-bumi, this is an alternative to politeknik. I took STPM, so I can tell you right away, it contains the hardest course material out of all of the alternatives presented to you. At least back in my day, it's harder than Cambridge/Edexcel A-levels, Australian matriculation, IB, Canadian Pre-U etc. Without accounting for the Chinese Gaokao (which is on another difficulty level), STPM is probably on a similar level of difficulty to IIT JEE (India) and Singapore A-levels internationally. The only other pre-university path that has similar difficulty level to STPM in Malaysia is the UEC (Chinese independent exam). Because of the difficulty of STPM, I generally advise against taking it, unless you're absolutely sure you are going to work hard. Otherwise you will suffer. Also, there's no guarantee that you'll get into public university even if you get good grades (unlike Asasi or Matrikulasi). \n","\n","Now, if you're interested in psychology and public university locally, your best bet is politeknik. I honestly wouldn't even consider STPM an option based on your SPM grades, unless you work really hard. Another option is to go the route of private local university if you're open to it. You'll need to pay, but there's always PTPTN loans.\n","--------------------\n","Comment by Emotional_Bedroom152: Have u considered stpm?\n","--------------------\n","Comment by charlesbytes85: First consider what your main interest is.\n","\n","Then, find out all the possible routes to that interest and quantify the cost for each route. Shortest route is normally the most expensive one.\n","\n","Finally, find out what's the best possible route that you can afford.\n","--------------------\n","Comment by Aggravating-Type153: i suggest you to retake maths, because that E is not even credit which most universities requires their students to at least have.\n","--------------------\n","Comment by charlesbytes85: Go to Politeknik. You will only need 3 credits (including Maths) to get in. Fee is RM200 per semester. Hostel is RM2/day.\n","\n","Study for 3 years. While there, consider what track you want to specialize in. Tracks may include software engineering, networking, infosec etc.\n","\n","Do well in it, and use your diploma to enter uni.

For the benefit of all the other students who want to ask a question like this, there's no such thing as which choice is \"better\". Better in terms of what? There are so many angles that you have to look at in order to say which is \"better\".\n","\n","  \n","Rather than asking which one is better I urge all the SPM leavers to think about 3 things when picking a course/career path:\n","\n","1. Think about what interests you. The last thing you wanna be doing is studying a course that you are not interested in. No matter how good of a student you are, spending 3-4 years studying something you dislike will burn you out.\n","\n","2. Think about what career do you want to pursue, and if there are prospects. This requires you to look at current market trends, and project out to the future when you graduate. Do you want to go into the industry/market? Do you want to be in academia? What kind of work do you want to be doing?\n","\n","3. If the career you really want to pursue doesn't have prospects in Malaysia, are you willing to move to anywhere else on earth in order to work in the said field?\n","\n","  \n","Look, do I have friends who picked a course in university/college, but ended up doing something completely different upon graduation? Sure, I have seen many. But is this the ideal way of picking a course/path to tread on, probably not. Everyone is adaptable, but if given a choice, I would say that ideally any individual would want to try to pick a course/career path that would match their interests.

They would give more useful, specific advice compared to the general advice we can give. But in theory, even if you had full A in every subject you should be able to retake.

I can tell you in general there are a couple of different paths to get into data science, but most data science positions in companies that I know of usually will require an advanced degree (Masters or PhD), or otherwise will require many years of work experience.\n","\n","I'm going to give you a run down of different paths to getting into ML related positions/work in general:\n","\n","1. Computer science degree with a focus in AI/ML. This is probably the common path.\n","2. Data science degree. I'm starting to see some universities offering undergraduate data science degrees. Not sure how the market will be like when these folks graduate, but I still think that most companies will hire those with advance degrees only for ML positions. Most data science degrees today are at least Masters level and above.\n","3. Applied Math/Statistics degree. Since ML is heavily steeped in statistics, usually folks in stats are extremely well suited to do data science.\n","4. Engineering. There are 3 engineering disciplines that tend to come into contact with ML. Industrial Engineering/Financial Engineering/Operations Research is one of them, since they are heavily steeped in quantitative analysis. Biomedical engineering, specifically those who work on bio informatics since it has the most usage of statistics. Finally Electrical Engineering, specifically those who work on Signals and Systems (telecommunication, robotics, computer vision etc. fall under this category), since this is the discipline that uses the most amount of statistics.\n","5. Physics/Chemistry/Biology science degree . You may think this is surprising, But usually if you're in one of these 3 sciences and you are working on modelling molecular/atomic or quantum behavior (eg protein folding, drug synthesis etc.), you're very likely to have some knowledge of ML algorithms due to the nature of your work.\n","\n","Honestly it really depends on what kind of data science job are you into. You can DM me if you want more information about how I use AI/ML in general in my work.\n","--------------------\n","Comment by PrestigiousElk5990: unless you want to go into oil and gas, it isn't really worth it\n","--------------------\n","Comment by stuffsurgeon: On top of what another reply said, there are two fields that comes to my mind which need geophysics. One of them is oil and gas (most lucrative), the other one is mining. This is from a private sector side of things. If you want to be in academia then the answer is different, since people go into different fields in academia for purposes beyond monetary gains, and most of them end up in their fields because of passion or an interest to serve a greater purpose.  \n","\n","This is more personal, but my advice to students who are interested in fields that are in the niche areas, is to look beyond the boundaries of Malaysia. Unless you have a strong fear of being mobile, you should not restrict yourself to opportunities in Malaysia especially if you're really interested in a particular field.

Those are critical roles when it comes to data science. But if you want to get into the more algorithmic side of things then that would usually require advanced degrees or many years of experience.

If you're talking about marketing data, or business data (like surveys etc.), that would fall under software engineering for data collection and maintaining a database of user feedback. If you're talking about other kinds of ML like obtaining data from simulation of protein folding, satellite data for weather forecasting, or other kinds of data like device (IOT or edge hardware) performance data, these usually require some level of subject matter expertise. There's a reason why being a subject matter expert + having knowledge of ML techniques is a combination of skillset that's heavily sought after in the market. \n","\n","  \n","Communicating results usually isn't a separate role. The researcher who's involved with designing algorithms to sort and analyze the data usually presents the results/insights. Ask yourself, if I did all the work to design a methodology or visualization of the data to obtain a conclusion or insight, why would I need someone else to present the said results?

While out hunting he is attacked by a tiger, and his native guides run away, leaving him for dead. But the tiger is the pet of Ulah, a beautiful young woman who grew up by herself in the jungle. She rescues Chris and takes him back to her cave, where she nurses him to health and falls in love with him. When he eventually returns to camp, she follows. His fiancée is jealous, and the natives do not like Ulah or her pet tiger either, all of which leads to a lot of trouble*.\"\n","\n","Filmed on location in Paramount's Hollywood studios, the movie manages to re-creating the Malayan jungle and even hires dozens of  Malay-looking extras who even speak Malay. The lead star Dorothy Lamour speaks Malay almost throughout the movie and sings a love song in Malay ('Bulan di malam'). '\n","\n","The Jungle Princess' was a major hit and launched Lamour's career. She was later often cast, sarong-clad, in similar jungle adventure romances, hence nicknamed the \"Sarong Queen\" throughout her career.\n","\n","PS: According to my friend who is a Johorean, it is rumoured that the Sultan of Johore is very interested in Lamour and wants her to be his wife but somehow she managed to rebuff his advances by saying that she is already spoken for as the main reason.\n","\n","[More details in WIki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle_Princess)\n","\n","[IMDB entry](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027830/)\n","--------------------\n","========================================\n"]}],"source":["submissions = subreddit.hot(limit=10)\n","\n","# Print the comments of each submission\n","for submission in submissions:\n","    print(f\"Submission title: {submission.title}\")\n","    submission.comments.replace_more(limit=0)  # Replace \"more comments\" with actual comments\n","    for comment in submission.comments.list():\n","        print(f\"Comment by {comment.author}: {comment.body}\")\n","        print(\"-\" * 20)\n","    print(\"=\" * 40)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"kPNVNapBKcly"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4aZ2OSd_Kclz"},"source":["Print two comments associated with each of these submissions:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":23,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":81419,"status":"ok","timestamp":1685521718870,"user":{"displayName":"Maheshkumar Paik","userId":"02349378107593826691"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"RO4ppDPJKcl0","outputId":"523482f9-0c62-42c2-d039-f0b34962ba26"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["How come the code:\n","print(\"0123456789\"[::2])\n","Prints 02468, meaning prints the first character and then in jumps of two.\n","But the code:\n","print(\"0123456789\"[::-1])\n","Prints 9876543210, meaning jumps -1 characters first and only then prints?\n","Am I understanding something wrong here?\n","\\[Pandas\\] why do i have to put the \".index\" in this line (data.drop(data\\[data\\['Weight'\\] > 4000\\].index, inplace=True) ) to make it work?

It you have a form for entering say, the data about a student, I would expect a student class, not a student-form class. Your Student class might have an init function that accepts the data from the form but still the class represents a student, not a form.\n","\n","Does that make sense?\n","Congrats on getting your program up and running.\n","\n","Now that you've gone and done that, you might notice that there is a lot of similar code here: each major if/elif block covers cases for winning, losing and a tie.

For example, a dictionary would handle this quite nicely, or if you haven't used them before, you could get by with two lists.\n","\n","Also, you might be able to get by with using the standard `random` module in place of `numpy`.\n","`numpy.random` gives you no benefit over `random` when operating with scalars, in fact it's probably slower here.

For example, a `Car` class can inherit from a `Vehicle` class, gaining its features while adding its own.\n","Most tutorials on the topic are rather confusing. OOP and classes are mostly a way to organise your code. Unlike what most tutorials would lead you to assume, objects in OOP do not have to be objects in real life. OOP (at least in Python, I am not experienced enough with other languages like Java to have a strong opinion about how it is used in that context) should be seen as a way to organise methods and attributes (variables and functions). One example is to bundle all methods and attributes in a single class if they are related to your login logic. Some might even be decorated as private to show that they are there just because it is cleaner that way (but don't use the object). \n","\n","As for inheritance, it is the same concept of organising things, only this time you decide what is common and what is different. \n","\n","But the key to understand OOP and classes is to understand that it is just about organising the code, it has very little to do with what the attributes and methods represent in real life, which is the issue with most tutorial talking about cars, bananas, or dogs.\n","I think it is fine and not overly bloated. You could also use min() and max() to make the calculation a one liner if you prefer:\n","\n","    gross_pay = min(40,h) * r + max(0,h-40)*r*1.5\n","\n","Aside from that you should get into the habit of using explanatory variable names, for a short script like that using „x“ is ok, but when stuff gets longer and more complicated a name like „overtime_hours“ would probably be more clear. Same goes for „h“ and „r“.\n","\n","Edit: swapped min and max, had them mixed up.\n","It doesn't really matter here but just FYI for anyone working with money, `float` variables are generally not used to handle money because there can be errors with precision. You'd want to use a more precise data type like `decimal` or store money as number of pennies and use `int`. \n","\n","It doesn't matter in this case (you can just ignore my advice) but handling \"real world\" money requires a different data type. And I agree completely with /u/GoingToSimbabwe that you should be using more descriptive variable names.
